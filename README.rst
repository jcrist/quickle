``quickle`` is a fast and small serialization format for a subset of Python
types. It's based off of `Pickle
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>`__, but includes several
optimizations and extensions to provide improved performance and security. For
supported types, serializing a message with ``quickle`` can be *~2-10x faster*
than using ``pickle``.
